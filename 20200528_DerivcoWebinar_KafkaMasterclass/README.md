# Derivco Webinar - 2020-05-28

The files in this directory contain the various code snippets used within the webinar.

The code is intended for demonstration purposes only.

The webinar had two technical sessions:
1. Simple producer and consumer
2. Python Producer, KSQL, Notebook example

## Kafka Cluster
Before you get started, you will need a running Kafka cluster.
The code in the examples assume a local cluster on port 9092.

To get a local cluster up you can look at this quickstart:
https://ksqldb.io/quickstart.html

## 1. Simple Producer and Consumer
- The Producer and Consumer projects can be used for this.
- With the dotnet sdk installed, you can open the directory in a shell and type '''dotnet run''' to start the app.

## 2. ksqlDB and data analysis
- Start by running the python_producer
- Run the manual steps and queries in the Queries.txt file, one by one.
- You can now open the webinar_ui code in Visual Studio
- You can now run through the Python Jupyter notebook in VS Code or an editor of your choice.
